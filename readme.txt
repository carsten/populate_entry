Version: 1.0.0
Author: Carsten de Vries <carsten@vrieswerk.nl>
Build Date: 23 July 2009
Github Repository: http://github.com/carsten/populate_entry/tree/master
Requirements: Symphony 2

Choose an existing entry and with its existing values create a new entry. Use
the link that is added to the end of each table row in the entry overview. To
populate an existing entry with data from another entry, open the entry you
wish to populate and put ?from-entry=ENTRY_ID behind the pages URL.

To do: add support for more field types (from extensions). Improve the way
existing entries can be populated.

2. Enable it by selecting "Populate Entry", choose Enable from the
   with-selected menu, then click Apply.

   entries.
